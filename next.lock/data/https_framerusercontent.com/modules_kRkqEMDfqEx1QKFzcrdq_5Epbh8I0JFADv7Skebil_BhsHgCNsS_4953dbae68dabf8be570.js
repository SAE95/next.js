This unique Pok\xe9mon does not evolve into or from any other Pok\xe9mon. It's believed to be an ancient relative of the Pok\xe9mon Donphan. Great Tusk is a large, gray Pok\xe9mon with significant physical bulk contributing to its immense offensive abilities. One of its distinctive features is its long black trunk that arcs over its head, highlighting its connection to the Donphan lineage. \n\nNotably, Great Tusk possesses the Protosynthesis ability. This unique ability enhances the user's highest stat by 30%, and up to 50% for speed, specifically when the Sunny Day condition is met in battle or if the Booster Energy is attached. As a result of its typing and bulk, Great Tusk is capable of using high-Base Power Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) attacks, making it a highly effective offensive player. \n\nGreat Tusk is regarded as the best offensive Rapid Spin user and a highly capable wallbreaker in combat. It is also a significant feature in the Path of Legends storyline in Pok\xe9mon Scarlet, offering players the challenge of battling this ancient Titan Pok\xe9mon.

This Pok\xe9mon is the evolution of Nosepass, which happens when a Nosepass levels up in a special magnetic field. It resembles an Easter Island statue combined with a magnet, and is typically blue-gray in color with a big red nose.\n\nProbopass has three smaller "Mini-Noses" which can detach from its body and move independently. It relates to magnetism, where it controls three smaller units with magnetic force. Its body acts as a powerful magnet and it uses this power to control the three smaller units. As these magnetic bodies form a horizonal line with Probopass, it tends to point in exactly the North direction, thus, earning it the nickname Compass Pok\xe9mon. The gender ratio is 50% male, 50% female. \n\nIt is portrayed as a defensive and slow Pok\xe9mon, excelling in taking hits but usually moving after its opponents due to its low speed. Its flagship moves include Rock Slide, and other electric, rock, and steel-type moves.',[y]:"Sturdy",[b]:"When this Pok\xe9mon is at full HP, any hit that would knock it out will instead leave it with 1 HP.
